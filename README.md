# Machine-Learning-Assignments

**This project is only for SWJTU's students providing their assignments.**

Please upload your source code in zip file format and name it with your ID and name, e.g.ï¼Œ ID-NAME.

Do not worry that others could copy your codes, cos we will check the source code and there is no too much spare time for them to plagiarize.

*HINT: Please ask your classmate's help to upload your assignment if you can not connect to the GitHub website.*
